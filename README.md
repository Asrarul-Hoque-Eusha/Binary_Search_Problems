# Binary_Search_Problems
Here are solutions of some Binary Search Related Problems.

## 1.Finding square root of given number
Square root can be found using binary search. 

## 2.Finding Minimum element in Rotated Array
A rotated array which was sorted before rotating. Rotation may perform at right or left. The task is to find minimum element from the array. We can find it using Binary Search. Complexity O(logn).

Here we can consider two array ={5, 6, 8, 9, 2, 4} and {9, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
## 3.Finding Peak in an array in which 1st portion is in increasing order and 2nd portion is in decreasing order
Consider the array {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}. The task is to find maximum element from the array. We can do it by using binary search with O(logn) time complexity.
